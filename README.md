# Computer Vision for Distracted Driving Detection

## Objective
The goal of this notebook is to utilize neural networks to accurately classify driver activities related to distracted driving. The model will classify activities into the following categories:

- c0: Safe driving
- c1: Texting - right
- c2: Talking on the phone - right
- c3: Texting - left
- c4: Talking on the phone - left
- c5: Operating the radio
- c6: Drinking
- c7: Reaching behind
- c8: Hair and makeup
- c9: Talking to passenger

## Process Overview
This task will be approached in the following steps:

1. Transfer learning with the VGG16 base model will be applied as the initial approach.
2. A convolutional neural network (CNN) will be developed from scratch, utilizing the Adam optimizer.
3. Finally, the results of both approaches will be evaluated and compared.
